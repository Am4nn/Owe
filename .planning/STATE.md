# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Users can split expenses, track shared debts, and settle up with friends without limits, ads, or paywalls — in a UI that feels like a modern bank app, not a spreadsheet.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (schema migration, seed, CI)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 22%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2/3 | 4 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01, 01-02
- Trend: Fast (schema and scaffold work)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Foundation]: Store all monetary amounts as INTEGER cents; use dinero.js v2 for all client arithmetic — float arithmetic causes irrecoverable $0.01 ghost debts
- [Foundation]: RLS must be enabled on every table in migration 001 — missing RLS on expense_splits or settlements leaks financial data across groups
- [Foundation]: EAS custom dev client required from day one — MMKV v4, expo-notifications, and bottom-sheet all require custom native builds unavailable in Expo Go
- [Foundation]: Pin tailwindcss@^3.4.17 — installing Tailwind v4 silently breaks NativeWind 4.x
- [Foundation]: service_role key must never appear in the mobile bundle — CI check required to scan built JS bundle
- [01-02]: fx_rate_at_creation set on INSERT and never updated — prevents balance drift from FX rate changes post-creation
- [01-02]: idempotency_key UUID UNIQUE on expenses and settlements — makes mobile POST retries safe (offline-first requirement)
- [01-02]: group_members.user_id nullable — NULL represents named-only (non-app) member per GRUP-03
- [01-02]: SECURITY DEFINER + SET search_path = '' on profiles trigger — prevents privilege escalation via search path injection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Schulman's debt simplification algorithm in Deno Edge Function has implementation nuances — consider a brief research check before building the debt-simplify Edge Function
- [Phase 3]: EAS Push + OneSignal token lifecycle has integration gotchas around token expiry and reinstall — dedicated research pass recommended before building push-notify chain
- [Phase 3]: Supabase Edge Function cron scheduling maturity for recurring expenses should be verified at Phase 3 planning time (v2 requirement, but affects fx-rates-cache design)
- [Supabase Link]: supabase link --project-ref <ref> and supabase db push must be run manually to apply migration to hosted project
