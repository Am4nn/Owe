# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Users can split expenses, track shared debts, and settle up with friends without limits, ads, or paywalls — in a UI that feels like a modern bank app, not a spreadsheet.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Foundation]: Store all monetary amounts as INTEGER cents; use dinero.js v2 for all client arithmetic — float arithmetic causes irrecoverable $0.01 ghost debts
- [Foundation]: RLS must be enabled on every table in migration 001 — missing RLS on expense_splits or settlements leaks financial data across groups
- [Foundation]: EAS custom dev client required from day one — MMKV v4, expo-notifications, and bottom-sheet all require custom native builds unavailable in Expo Go
- [Foundation]: Pin tailwindcss@^3.4.17 — installing Tailwind v4 silently breaks NativeWind 4.x
- [Foundation]: service_role key must never appear in the mobile bundle — CI check required to scan built JS bundle

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Schulman's debt simplification algorithm in Deno Edge Function has implementation nuances — consider a brief research check before building the debt-simplify Edge Function
- [Phase 3]: EAS Push + OneSignal token lifecycle has integration gotchas around token expiry and reinstall — dedicated research pass recommended before building push-notify chain
- [Phase 3]: Supabase Edge Function cron scheduling maturity for recurring expenses should be verified at Phase 3 planning time (v2 requirement, but affects fx-rates-cache design)
