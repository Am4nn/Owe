# Phase 7 Plan 01: Bug Fixes

## Context

Bugs discovered over multiple physical device + web test sessions on 2026-03-02.

**Session 1** — first run on physical Android device. Testing partially blocked by BUG-01
(GRANT permissions missing). After that fix, BUG-02 through BUG-06 surfaced.

**Session 2** — after applying round-1 fixes, further bugs on mobile and web surfaced
(BUG-07 through BUG-11).

**Session 3** — further functional bugs: invite modal, leave group FK violation, send invite
permission error, leave group on web, invite success UX.

**Session 4** — final confirmations + two new bugs: GO_BACK navigation error on web after
leaving group (BUG-16), FAB child buttons and Alert.alert broken on web (BUG-17).

## Bug Registry

### BUG-01 — GRANT permissions missing on all tables ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** `permission denied for table group_members / profiles` (HTTP 403, PG 42501)
**Root cause:** Zero GRANT statements in any migration. PostgreSQL requires both a table-level
GRANT and a matching RLS policy. Only policies existed, no GRANTs.
**Fix:** Migration `20260302000007_grant_table_permissions.sql` — GRANT SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
on all 12 app tables to the `authenticated` role.
**Commit:** `8f4d75c`

---

### BUG-02 — Add Expense error on mobile ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom (session 1):** Tapping "Add expense" did nothing — no error, no navigation.
**Symptom (session 2):** Expense IS created now but app throws `Error: Property 'crypto' doesn't
exist` (visible after reload).
**Root causes:**
1. Zod schema had `payer_member_id: z.string().uuid('Select a payer')` — blocked silent submit in direct mode. **Fixed** in commit `842a61a` (made optional).
2. `crypto.randomUUID()` is not available on React Native / Hermes. **Fixed** in commit `fa07e73` (replaced with `ExpoCrypto.randomUUID()` from the installed `expo-crypto` package).
**Files:** `app/(app)/expenses/new.tsx`
**Commits:** `842a61a`, `fa07e73`

---

### BUG-03 — `useGroup('')` fires invalid UUID API request ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** `GET /rest/v1/groups?select=*&id=eq.` → 400 `22P02 invalid input syntax for type uuid: ""`
**Root cause:** `useGroup(groupId ?? '')` called with empty string in direct mode.
**Fix:** Added `enabled: !!groupId` to the `useGroup` query in `src/features/groups/hooks.ts`.
**Commit:** `842a61a`

---

### BUG-04 — No way to create a group (FAB missing "New Group") ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** No "New Group" button anywhere. `app/(app)/groups/new.tsx` exists but unreachable.
**Root cause:** `ExpandableFAB.tsx` was missing the child button.
**Fix:** Added "New Group" at offsetY -160; shifted Transfer to -240, Scan Receipt to -320.
**File:** `src/components/ui/ExpandableFAB.tsx`
**Commit:** `842a61a`

---

### BUG-05 — expo-notifications sound 'default' console error ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** "expo-notifications: Custom sound 'default' not found in native app."
**Root cause:** `sound: 'default'` in `setNotificationChannelAsync` is treated as a custom file
name, not the system default.
**Fix:** Removed the `sound` field entirely from the channel config.
**File:** `src/features/notifications/hooks.ts`
**Commit:** `842a61a`

---

### BUG-06 — expo-notifications APIs crash on web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** Web console: "ExpoNotifications is not available on web".
**Root cause:** `Notifications.setNotificationHandler(...)` ran at module-load time unconditionally.
**Fix:** Wrapped module-level handler and all calls in `registerPushToken` /
`useNotificationDeepLink` with `Platform.OS !== 'web'` guards.
**File:** `src/features/notifications/hooks.ts`
**Commit:** `842a61a`

---

### BUG-07 — `crypto.randomUUID()` crashes on Android ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** After recording a settlement, app throws `Error: Property 'crypto' doesn't exist`.
**Root cause:** React Native / Hermes does not expose the global `crypto` Web API.
**Fix:** Replaced `crypto.randomUUID()` with `ExpoCrypto.randomUUID()` from `expo-crypto`.
**Files:** `app/(app)/expenses/new.tsx`, `app/(app)/settlement/new.tsx`
**Commit:** `fa07e73`

---

### BUG-08 — GestureHandlerRootView missing → crash on group tap ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** Tapping a group on the dashboard throws: "GestureDetector must be used as a
descendant of GestureHandlerRootView."
**Root cause:** `react-native-gesture-handler` requires `GestureHandlerRootView` at the app root.
It was never added.
**Fix:** Wrapped `RootLayout` return value with `<GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>`.
**File:** `app/_layout.tsx`
**Commit:** `fa07e73`

---

### BUG-09 — WebBrowser.warmUpAsync / coolDownAsync crash on web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** Web console: "The method or property WebBrowser.warmUpAsync is not available on web."
**Root cause:** Chrome Custom Tabs warm-up is a native-only Android API called unconditionally.
**Fix:** Added `if (Platform.OS === 'web') return` inside both `useEffect` hooks.
**Files:** `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`, `app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`
**Commit:** `fa07e73`

---

### BUG-10 — Uncontrolled → controlled input warning on web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** Web console: "A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled."
**Root cause:** `useForm` in auth screens had no `defaultValues` — fields started as `undefined`
(uncontrolled on web DOM) and became strings on first keypress (controlled).
**Fix:** Added explicit `defaultValues` to both sign-in and sign-up forms.
**Files:** `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`, `app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx`
**Commit:** `fa07e73`

---

### BUG-11 — NativeWind dark mode 'media' warning on web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** Web console: "Cannot manually set color scheme, as dark mode is type 'media'.
Please use StyleSheet.setFlag('darkMode', 'class')."
**Root cause:** NativeWind defaults to `media` dark mode strategy on web and warns when trying
to force programmatic dark mode.
**Fix:**
1. Added `darkMode: 'class'` to `tailwind.config.js`.
2. Added `StyleSheet.setFlag?.('darkMode', 'class')` in `app/_layout.tsx` behind a
   `Platform.OS === 'web'` guard.
**Files:** `tailwind.config.js`, `app/_layout.tsx`
**Commit:** `fa07e73`

---

### BUG-12 — Alert.prompt crashes on Android and web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** "Alert.default.prompt is not a function" when tapping "Invite by email" on web
(and Android, which also lacks Alert.prompt).
**Root cause:** `Alert.prompt` is iOS-only. The invite handler in
`app/(app)/groups/[id]/index.tsx` called it unconditionally.
**Fix:** Replaced `Alert.prompt` with a cross-platform slide-up `Modal` + `TextInput` following
the same pattern already used in the screen for the currency and reminder-delay pickers.
Added `showInviteModal` / `inviteEmail` state; split handler into `handleInvite` (open modal)
and `handleSendInvite` (submit).
**File:** `app/(app)/groups/[id]/index.tsx`
**Commit:** `97d54fe`

---

### BUG-12b — "Send Invite" permission denied for table users ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** After BUG-12 modal fix, tapping "Send Invite" returned `Error: permission denied
for table users`.
**Root cause:** The `group_invites` SELECT policy contained `SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE
id = auth.uid()`. The `authenticated` role has no access to `auth.users`. This fires on every
`.insert().select()` call because RETURNING triggers the SELECT policy.
**Fix:** Migration `20260302000009_fix_invites_rls.sql` — dropped old policy and recreated with
`invited_email = auth.email()` (Supabase built-in, no table access needed).
**Commit:** `c46b50c`

---

### BUG-13 — Leave group FK violation ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** "update or delete on table group_members violates foreign key constraint
`expenses_player_id_fkey` on table expenses".
**Root cause:** `useLeaveGroup` was doing a `DELETE` on the `group_members` row. Three FK
constraints reference `group_members(id)` without `ON DELETE CASCADE`:
`expenses.payer_id`, `expense_splits.member_id`, `settlements.payer_id/payee_id`.
Deleting the row violates all of them.
**Fix:**
- Migration `20260302000008_leave_group_rls.sql`: adds `UPDATE` RLS policy
  `members_can_unlink_themselves` (`WITH CHECK (user_id IS NULL)`) so users can set their
  own `user_id = NULL`.
- `useLeaveGroup` now calls `.update({ user_id: null })` instead of `.delete()`.
  Converting to named-only preserves all historical data; display_name stays intact.
  PostgreSQL's `UNIQUE(group_id, user_id)` allows multiple NULLs.
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/20260302000008_leave_group_rls.sql`, `src/features/groups/hooks.ts`
**Commit:** `a6bb286`

### BUG-14 — Leave group "nothing happens" on web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** Tapping "Leave Group" on web does nothing. Works fine on mobile.
**Root cause:** `Alert.alert` with multiple buttons on web is implemented via `window.confirm`,
which is silently blocked by most browsers (popup blocker or sandboxed iframe context).
The confirmation dialog never appears, so the `onPress` callback never fires.
**Fix:** Replaced `Alert.alert` confirmation with a cross-platform transparent overlay `Modal`
(same pattern as invite and delay picker modals). `handleLeave` now opens `showLeaveModal`;
`handleConfirmLeave` fires the actual mutation.
**File:** `app/(app)/groups/[id]/index.tsx`
**Commit:** `c319544`

---

### BUG-15 — Invite success not shown on web + misleading copy ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom (web):** After sending invite, the modal closes but no success confirmation appears.
**Symptom (all):** Success message said "Invite sent" implying an email was dispatched — but
no email delivery mechanism exists in the codebase.
**Root causes:**
1. `Alert.alert('Invite sent', ...)` after closing the modal uses `window.alert` on web,
   which is blocked in sandboxed contexts.
2. No Edge Function / webhook exists to send email — invite is only saved to `group_invites`.
**Fix:**
- Added `inviteSent` state to the modal. On success, shows inline `✓ Invite saved!` with
  accurate message ("will be added when they sign up") and auto-dismisses after 2.5s.
- Removed the post-close `Alert.alert` entirely on both platforms.
- Added `(Email delivery coming soon)` note to set correct user expectations.
**Known gap:** Actual email delivery requires a Supabase Edge Function (deferred to Phase 13).
**File:** `app/(app)/groups/[id]/index.tsx`
**Commit:** `41e2b8c`

---

### BUG-16 — GO_BACK not handled after leaving group on web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** After confirming leave group on web, app throws: "The action 'GO_BACK' was not
handled by any navigator."
**Root cause:** `handleConfirmLeave` called `router.back()` unconditionally. On web, if the
user opened the group detail screen directly (no prior navigation history), the stack is empty
and `router.back()` finds no screen to go back to.
**Fix:** Changed `onSuccess` callback to `router.canGoBack() ? router.back() : router.replace('/(app)')`.
This falls back to replacing the current screen with the app root when there is no back stack.
**File:** `app/(app)/groups/[id]/index.tsx`

---

### BUG-17 — FAB child buttons / "coming soon" popups not working on web ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED
**Symptom:** On web, tapping the FAB shows no child buttons (or child buttons appear but tapping
"Scan Receipt" / "Add Transfer" shows no popup).
**Root causes:**
1. `Animated.createAnimatedComponent(TouchableOpacity)` has limited React Native Web support;
   invisible (opacity=0) buttons could still intercept touches.
2. No `zIndex` on the FAB container — `elevation` is Android-only and ignored on web, so FAB
   buttons may render behind other content.
3. `Alert.alert` used for "coming soon" messages is unreliable on web (blocked in sandboxed
   contexts / react-native-web implementation inconsistencies).
**Fix:**
- Switched `ChildFABButton` from `AnimatedTouchable` (createAnimatedComponent(TouchableOpacity))
  to `Animated.View` wrapping a plain `TouchableOpacity` — better web animation support.
- Added `pointerEvents={isVisible ? 'auto' : 'none'}` to `Animated.View` using a JS-side
  `isOpenState` mirror of the Reanimated shared value.
- Added `zIndex: 1000` to FAB container (and `1001` to main button, `999` to children).
- Replaced `Alert.alert('Coming soon', ...)` in "Add Transfer" and "Scan Receipt" with an
  inline toast: a small `View` that appears near the FAB and auto-dismisses after 2.5s.
**File:** `src/components/ui/ExpandableFAB.tsx`
